# QuantSeq Analysis Pipeline for the Chimera Project
This GitHub repo holds the [NextFlow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflow for reproducible analysis of the RNA-seq datasets created in the [Chimera project](https://github.com/DimmestP/chimera_project_manuscript).

[QuantSeq](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.f.376) is an RNA-seq assay that quantifies the 3'UTR isoforms of mRNA transcripts and enables investigations into alternative polyadenylation usage. 

The primary purpose of this experiment is to determine whether the insertion of decay motifs into the 3'UTRs of RPS3 and TSA1 terminators changes the usage of polyA sites.
